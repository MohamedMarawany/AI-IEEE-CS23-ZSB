1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,515
Congratulations! You reached the end of the lesson.

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:05,985
You've gone through the entire data analysis process,

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,580
from posing questions to working with data using

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,169
Pandas and creating visualizations with Matplotlib.

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,714
With the basics of analyzing data in Python,

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:18,750
you've started your journey in data analysis with a solid foundation.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,379
In the next two lessons,

8
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,109
we'll focus on going through this process in

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,500
more detail from start to finish on two data sets.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,364
And, you learn more about Numpy,

11
00:00:27,364 --> 00:00:30,000
Pandas and Matplotlib. See you there.
